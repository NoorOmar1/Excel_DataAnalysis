This project showcases end-to-end data processing and visualization skills using Microsoft Excel.
I began with raw, messy data, applying various techniques to ensure quality and structure.
The clean data was then leveraged to build multiple Pivot Tables for aggregation and analysis. 
The final output is a single-page, interactive dashboard that allows users to quickly filter, explore key metrics, and derive meaningful insights without needing to manipulate the underlying data.
